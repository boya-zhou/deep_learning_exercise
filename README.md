assignment in Udacity Deep Learning, in TensorFlow

## A1: Introduction

1. Display Images
2. Verify Normalized Images
3. Verify Data Is Balanced
4. Shuffle Samples And Verify
5. Find Overlapping Samples
6. Train A Simple ML Model

## A2: Stochastic Gradient Descent

- Train a fully-connected network using Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Your new model should perform better than the one you developed for Assignment 1. Also, the time required to train using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) should be considerably less than simple Gradient Descent (GD).

## A3: Regularization

- Use regularization techniques to improve a deep learning model
